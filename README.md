# ZZ_Proyecto_ZombyVsHumanity

## University Project

### Overview
The Zombies vs. Humanity project is a university project aimed at implementing a simulation of a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is under attack from a virus that turns humans into zombies. The surviving humans have sought refuge in strongholds to protect themselves from the relentless zombie onslaught.

### Project Description
This project features a Java-based simulation where players must defend strongholds from zombie attacks using various weapons with unique capabilities. The zombies themselves possess different methods of attack, adding depth and challenge to the gameplay experience.

One of the key aspects of this project is the implementation of inheritance and class hierarchies to model the interactions between different entities in the simulation, such as humans, zombies, and weapons. Additionally, the project incorporates the use of serialized files to save and load game states, allowing players to resume their progress at a later time.

Moreover, the project utilizes multi-threading to handle concurrent processes efficiently, enhancing the realism and dynamism of the simulation. Finally, the project includes a user interface to provide players with a visually engaging and intuitive way to interact with the game environment.

### Technologies Used
- Java
- NetBeans
- Serialized files for saving and loading game states
- Multi-threading for efficient concurrent processing
